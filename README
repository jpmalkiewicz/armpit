Armpit Scheme Version 050

(c) 2006-2012, Hubert Montas

Please read license (MIT) in source code file: armpit_050.s

-----------------------------------------------------------------
This Armpit Scheme distribution has a directory structure.
The file armpit_050.s at the top of the structure
(where this README is) imports the needed files for assembly.
Machine-independent source code, assembler macros and constants
are in the "common" sub-directory. Machine-specific header files
and source code are in the "mcu_dependent" sub-directory with
deeper sub-directories separated by MCU family (eg. LPC_2000).

Pre-built .bin and .hex files are included in the bin directory.
Corresponding .map files indicate addresses of some symbols.

To re-build (if desired), follow instructions at top of assembly
source code file armpit_050.s (uncomment and comment-out
needed options) then run the script: buildarmpit with input
arguments: cpu-type, version, board (see comments at top of
buildarmpit for examples). The buildarmpit script and the
armpit_build_link file that it relies on are in the top directory.
It reads the source in the top and sub- directories and writes
binary, hex and map files to the bin directory.
